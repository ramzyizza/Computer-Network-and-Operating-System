2. Perform Activity 2.2 using chrome as the web browser. Enter the same URL multiple times (at least two times) by pressing the Enter-key (not reload, i.e., F5). Chrome is well known to its resource-intensive characteristic where it tends to consume more memory,
3. Theoretically, TCP packet size can reach up to 64kB is size. Investigate why the TCP packets are usually sent in much smaller size (~15kB) compared its theoretical max size.
4. Do the module 2's Activity 4 and submit it to Activity 2.4. Search about Base64 encodingdecoding method and try to manually encode the following username and password: -user: students-ugm -pass: dcse. Show the encoding steps in detail.
